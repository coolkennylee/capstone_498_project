# capstone_498_group_project

In this tutorial, we will help fellow students and colleagues learn how to build and deploy a computer vision model that detects if someone is wearing a mask or not. We will utilize Google Cloud Platform as our core serverless infrastructure to build, train/model, and deploy an interactive application.

## Steps we will cover in this tutorial

(1) Setting up Google Cloud Platform and setting up a project

(2) Enabling required APIs such as: AutoML Vision API, App Engine, Cloud Build, and Stackdriver

(3) How to source/create datasets 

(4) Training, evaluating and exporting the model

(5) Building the application

(6) Deploying the application

(7) Implementing DevOps to implement automated, seamless CI/CD process

## Enabling Required APIs

Enable APIs by clicking on API & Services on the console and click enable, which will take you to a search engine. Type each API accordingly and click enable API.

(1) AutoML Vision

(2) App Engine + App Engine Admin API

(3) Cloud Build

(4) Stackdriver API

## Dataset

There are a few ways you can source image data for free or low-cost

(1) Existing, open-source github repos
    
    * Bullet List
      * Nested bullet
         * Sub-nested bullet
         
    *Bullet 2

(2) Kaggle practice dataset

(3) Bing image search API via




## Training, modeling, evaluating, and exporting TensorFlow model

## App development

Creating an index.html and index.js file

## Hosting the application on GCP

Using CloudShell to import app files and deploying GCP App Engine

## CI/CD

Stackdriver

Cloud Build
